## Mutating joins

Data is best used in R when in a single data table.  This course introduces a number of techniques to achieve this.  Dplyr also has connectors to a range of different databases, so can be used to both extract and manipulate data in databases.

### Keys

We often want to join two tables together, adding a set of values or variables from a second table(s).  For this to happen, we need a key, whereby we have a key in the initial table (a primary key) that is uniquely identifies rows in that within that table or dataset (we don't have duplicates) and we then use this key to add in data from a secondary table (the foreign key to that table).  The foreign key in the secondary table may be duplicated or not appear at all.  Sometimes no single variable acts as a primary key in a dataset. Instead, it takes a combination of variables to uniquely identify each row, for example a table of addresses with different columns representing sections of the address - house number, street name, postcode/zip code.

When working with dplyr, it works with the following tables for the purposes of joining data

* **Tables** in dplyr are one of the following:
* **data frames**
* **tibbles (tbl_df)** - similar to data frame but only what fits in to your R console window will be displayed but you can use View() all the table if needed 
* **tbl references**

```{r Dplyr Joins, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Joins available in Dplyr'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/DplyrJoins.png")
```

### Left and right joins

left_join() is the basic join function in dplyr. You can use it whenever you want to augment a data frame with information from another data frame.

For example, left_join(x, y) joins y to x. The second dataset you specify is joined to the first dataset. In right_join() the order of the datasets reversed

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Join artists to bands
bands2 <- left_join(bands, artists, by = c("first", "last"))

# Examine the results
bands2

# Recreate bands3 with a right join
bands2 <- left_join(bands, artists, by = c("first", "last"))
bands3 <- right_join(artists, bands, by = c("first", "last"))

# Check that bands3 is equal to bands2
setequal(bands2, bands3)
```

### Inner and full joins

Left_join and right_join are half of a class of 'mutating joins' with the name coming from dplyrs mutate() function which returns a copy of the dataset with one or more columns of the data added to it.  The other two functions are:

* **inner_join**: only retains rows from both/all datasets
* **full_join**: retains any row from both/any data set
* **%>%**: Can be used to string joins or other functions together

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create goal2 using full_join() and inner_join() 
goal2 <- artists %>%
  full_join(bands, by = c("first","last")) %>%
  inner_join(songs, by = c("first","last"))

# Create one table that combines all information
artists %>%
  full_join(bands, by = c("first","last")) %>%
  full_join(songs, by = c("first","last")) %>%
  full_join(albums, by = c("album", "band"))

```

## Filtering joins and set operations

Filtering joins returns a copy of the origianl data set rather than an augmented version of the original dataset.  

```{r Filtering Joins, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Filtering and Mutating Joins'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/FilteringJoins.png")
```

Semi_join() is one of the filtering join functions, it can be used to check which rows in one table match the rows in another table, perhaps before a mutating join.  Semi_join is sometimes easier than many seperate functions together, for instance

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# View the output of semi_join()
artists %>% 
  semi_join(songs, by = c("first", "last"))

# Create the same result
artists %>% 
  right_join(songs, by = c("first", "last")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(instrument)) %>% 
  select(first, last, instrument) 
```

Semi-joins provide a useful way to explore the connections between multiple tables of data.

For example, you can use a semi-join to determine the number of albums in the albums dataset that were made by a band in the bands dataset.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
albums %>% 
  # Collect the albums made by a band
  semi_join(bands, by = "band") %>% 
  # Count the albums made by a band
  nrow()
```

Anti-joins shows records which are in the primary table but do not have matches in the second data table.  This can be useful for checking spelling or key value errors.

```{r}
# Return rows of artists that don't have bands info
artists %>% 
  anti_join(bands, by = c("first", "last"))

# Check whether album names in labels are mis-entered
labels %>% 
  anti_join(albums, by = "album")
```

Joins can also be used to count the number of records.

```{r}
# Determine which key joins labels and songs
labels
songs

songs %>% 
  # Find the rows of songs that match a row in labels
  semi_join(labels, by = "album") %>% 
  # Number of matches between labels and songs
  nrow()
```

## Set Operations

When two datasets contain the same variables, it can be useful to combine the datasets with set operations (rather than joins).  The three set operations can be used to combine observations from two datasets in to a single dataset.

```{r Set Ops, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Set Operations'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/SetOps.png")
```

For instance we can count the number of unique songs in two data tables.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

# Import files
aerosmith <- read.csv("C:/Users/DEsktop/Nextcloud/Documents/2017/RData/aerosmith.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
greatest_hits <- read.csv("C:/Users/DEsktop/Nextcloud/Documents/2017/RData/greatest_hits.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

aerosmith %>% 
  # Create the new dataset using a set operation
  union(greatest_hits) %>% 
  # Count the total number of songs
  nrow()

```

Or use it to see which is in both (where the dataset has the exact same variables) - this is similar to the semi_join function.

```{r}
# Create the new dataset using a set operation
aerosmith %>% 
  intersect(greatest_hits)
```

Or use it to identify which are in one dataset but not the other.  Here, we also match on just the variable we are interested in that matches across both datasets.

```{r}
# Import file
live <- read.csv("C:/Users/DEsktop/Nextcloud/Documents/2017/RData/live.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Select the song names from live
live_songs <- live %>% select(song)

# Select the song names from greatest_hits
greatest_songs <- greatest_hits %>% select(song)

# Create the new dataset using a set operation - songs in live that are not in greatest_hits
live_songs %>% 
  setdiff(greatest_songs)
```

There is no set operation to find rows that appear in one data frame or another, but not both. However, you can accomplish this by combining set operators.

```{r}

live_songs <- live %>% select(song)
greatest_songs <- greatest_hits %>% select(song)

# Return the songs that only exist in one dataset
live_songs %>% 
  setdiff(greatest_songs) %>% 
  union(greatest_songs %>% 
  setdiff(live_songs))
```

**Note**: The union() function removes duplicate rows, even if a duplicate is desired (perhaps a different record such as someone with the same name).

Its common to want to know if one data set is the same as another dataset dplyr’s setequal will do this easily base R’s identical is will only return true if the datasets have the exact same rows in the exact same order

The definitive and complete contain the songs that appear in competing Led Zeppelin anthologies: The Definitive Collection and The Complete Studio Recordings, respectively.

Both anthologies claim to contain the complete studio recordings of Led Zeppelin, but do the anthologies contain the same exact songs?
```{r}
# Import files
complete <- read.csv("C:/Users/DEsktop/Nextcloud/Documents/2017/RData/complete.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
definitive <- read.csv("C:/Users/DEsktop/Nextcloud/Documents/2017/RData/definitive.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Check if same order: definitive and complete
identical(definitive, complete)

# Check if any order: definitive and complete
setequal(definitive, complete)

# Songs in definitive but not complete
complete %>% 
  setdiff(definitive)

# Songs in complete but not definitive
definitive %>%
  setdiff(complete)

# Return songs in definitive that are not in complete
definitive %>% 
  anti_join(complete, by = c("song", "album"))

# Return songs in complete that are not in definitive
complete %>% 
  anti_join(definitive, by = c("song", "album"))
```

It appears that The Definitive Collection contains songs from the soundtrack of The Song Remains the Same, a movie filmed during a live Led Zeppelin concert. Is this the only difference between The Definitive Collection and The Complete Studio Recordings?  

* **Remember**: base R’s identical is will only return true if the datasets have the exact same rows in the _exact_ same order.

```{r}
# Import file sounddtrack
soundtrack <- read.csv("C:/Users/DEsktop/Nextcloud/Documents/2017/RData/soundtrack.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Check if same order: definitive and union of complete and soundtrack
complete %>%
  union(soundtrack) %>%
  identical(definitive)


# Check if any order: definitive and union of complete and soundtrack
complete %>%
  union(soundtrack) %>%
  setequal(definitive)

```

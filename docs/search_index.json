Collaborators; Nick Carchedi and Tom Jeon. 1.1 Introduction to Inference Classical statistical inference is the process of making claims about a population based on a sample of information. We are making an inference from a small group (sample) to a much larger one (population). We typically have: Null Hypothesis \\(H_{0}\\): What we are researching has no effect Alternate Hypothesis \\(H_{A}\\): What we are researching does have an effect Under the null hypthesis, chance alone is responsible for the results. Under the alternate hypothesis, we reject the null hypthesis, by using statisitcal techniques that indicate that chance is not responsible for our findings. The following summarises the history of significance testing succinctly: “Significance testing is largely the product of Karl Pearson (p-value, Pearson’s chi-squared test), William Sealy Gosset (Student’s t-distribution), and Ronald Fisher (”null hypothesis“, analysis of variance,”significance test“), while hypothesis testing was developed by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson (son of Karl)…Modern hypothesis testing is an inconsistent hybrid of the Fisher vs Neyman/Pearson formulation, methods and terminology developed in the early 20th century. While hypothesis testing was popularized early in the 20th century, evidence of its use can be found much earlier [Such as Laplace in the 1770s]”. (Wikipedia 2017) "]

We are making an inference from a small group (sample) to a much larger one (population). We typically have: Null Hypothesis \\(H_{0}\\): What we are researching has no effect Alternate Hypothesis \\(H_{A}\\): What we are researching does have an effect Under the null hypothesis, chance alone is responsible for the results. Under the alternate hypothesis, we reject the null hypothesis, by using statistical techniques that indicate that chance is not responsible for our findings. Hypothesis or statistical testing goes back over 300 years, with the first recorded use by John Arbuthnot: Table 1.1: Statistical Testing Applications Year Person Context 1710 Arbuthnot Sex ratio at birth 1767 Michelle Distribution of stars 1823 Laplace Moon phase and barometric changes 1900 K. Pearson Goodness of fit 1908 Gosset A single mean Source: (Huberty 1993, pg 318) Contemporary statistical testing is a usually that of either Fisher or Neyman-Pearson approaches. Fisher tends to use a single hypothesis test and a p-value strength of evidence test, where as the Neyman-Pearson test will set a critical alpha value and compare the null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis, rejecting the null if the test statistic is high enough (Huberty 1993, pg 318). The course goes on to say that idea behind statistical inference is to understand samples from a hypothetical population, where the null hypothesis is true - there is no difference between two groups. We can do this by calculating one statistic - for instance the proportion (mean) of a test group who show a positive response when testing a new drug, compared to a placebo control group - for each repeated sample from a population, then work out the difference between these two groups means. With each sample, the mean will change, resulting in a changing difference for each sample. We can then generate a distribution (histogram) of differences, assuming the null hypothesis - that there is no link between drug effectiveness between a test group and a control group - is true. “Generating a distribution of the statistic from the null population gives information about whether the observed data are inconsistent with the null hypothesis”. That is to say, by taking repeated samples and creating a distribution, we can then say whether our observed difference is consistent (within an acceptable value range due to chance) to the null hypothesis. The null samples consist of randomly shuffled drug effectiveness variables (permuted samples from the population), so that the samples don’t have any dependency between the two groups and effectiveness. 1.2 Home Ownership by Gender Data used in the exercises are from NHANES 2009-2012 With Adjusted Weighting. This is survey data collected by the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) which has conducted a series of health and nutrition surveys since the early 1960’s. Since 1999 approximately 5,000 individuals of all ages are interviewed in their homes every year and complete the health examination component of the survey. The health examination is conducted in a mobile examination centre (MEC). The NHANES target population is “the non-institutionalized civilian resident population of the United States”. NHANES, (American National Health and Nutrition Examination surveys), use complex survey designs (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_162.pdf) that oversample certain subpopulations like racial minorities. # Load packages library(&quot;dplyr&quot;) library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) library(&quot;NHANES&quot;) library(&quot;oilabs&quot;) # Create bar plot for Home Ownership by Gender ggplot(NHANES, aes(x = Gender, fill = HomeOwn)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;fill&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Relative frequencies&quot;) # Density for SleepHrsNight coloured by SleepTrouble, faceted by HealthGen ggplot(NHANES, aes(x = SleepHrsNight, col = SleepTrouble)) + geom_density(adjust = 2) + facet_wrap(~ HealthGen) Next we want to create a selection for just our variables of interest - rent and owner occupation. # Subset the data: homes homes &lt;- NHANES %&gt;% select(Gender, HomeOwn) %&gt;% filter(HomeOwn %in% c(&quot;Own&quot;, &quot;Rent&quot;)) We build a distribution of differences assuming the null hypothesis - that there is no link between gender and home ownership - is true. In this first step, we just do a single iteration, or permutation from the true values. The null (permuted) version here will create a randomly shuffled home ownership variable, so that the permuted version does not have any dependency between gender and homeownership. We effectively have the same gender split variables as per the original, with the same owned and rented proportions, but disassociated from the gender variable - just randomly shuffled. # Perform one permutation homes %&gt;% mutate(HomeOwn_perm = sample(HomeOwn)) %&gt;% group_by(Gender) %&gt;% summarize(prop_own_perm = mean(HomeOwn_perm == &quot;Own&quot;), prop_own = mean(HomeOwn == &quot;Own&quot;)) %&gt;% summarize(diff_perm = diff(prop_own), diff_orig = diff(prop_own_perm)) ## # A tibble: 1 × 2 ## diff_perm diff_orig ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 -0.007828723 -0.0004148505 It is easier to see what is going on by breaking the results down iteratively. Our selected and filtered homes dataset looks like. head(homes) ## # A tibble: 6 × 2 ## Gender HomeOwn ## &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;fctr&gt; ## 1 male Own ## 2 male Own ## 3 male Own ## 4 male Own ## 5 female Rent ## 6 male Rent Next we shuffle this data, let’s call it homes 2. we can then check the total number of owns and rents are the same using the summary function, which confirms the data is just randomly shuffled. homes2 &lt;- homes %&gt;% mutate(HomeOwn_perm = sample(HomeOwn)) %&gt;% group_by(Gender) tail(homes2) ## Source: local data frame [6 x 3] ## Groups: Gender [2] ## ## Gender HomeOwn HomeOwn_perm ## &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;fctr&gt; ## 1 male Rent Own ## 2 male Rent Own ## 3 female Own Own ## 4 male Own Rent ## 5 male Own Rent ## 6 male Own Own summary(homes2) ## Gender HomeOwn HomeOwn_perm ## female:4890 Own :6425 Own :6425 ## male :4822 Rent :3287 Rent :3287 ## Other: 0 Other: 0 Then we calculate the mean value of home ownership (Own) across our original and shuffled (permutated) data homes3 &lt;- homes2 %&gt;% summarize(prop_own_perm = mean(HomeOwn_perm == &quot;Own&quot;), prop_own = mean(HomeOwn == &quot;Own&quot;)) homes3 ## # A tibble: 2 × 3 ## Gender prop_own_perm prop_own ## &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 female 0.6705521 0.6654397 ## 2 male 0.6524264 0.6576109 FFinally we calculate the differences in ownership - note that the difference for the permuted value here may be different from the full code above, as it a new random permutation and we have used the set.seed() function which would create an identical permutation. homes4 &lt;- homes3 %&gt;% summarize(diff_perm = diff(prop_own), diff_orig = diff(prop_own_perm)) homes4 ## # A tibble: 1 × 2 ## diff_perm diff_orig ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 -0.007828723 -0.01812577 Next we can make multiple permutations using the rep_sample_n from the oilabs package. We specify the data (tbl), the sample size, the number of samples to take (reps), and whether sampling should be done with or without replacement (replace). The output includes a new column, replicate, which indicates the sample number. We can create 100 permutations and create a dot plot of the results. # Perform 100 permutations homeown_perm &lt;- homes %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = nrow(homes), reps = 100) %&gt;% mutate(HomeOwn_perm = sample(HomeOwn)) %&gt;% group_by(replicate, Gender) %&gt;% summarize(prop_own_perm = mean(HomeOwn_perm == &quot;Own&quot;), prop_own = mean(HomeOwn == &quot;Own&quot;)) %&gt;% summarize(diff_perm = diff(prop_own_perm), diff_orig = diff(prop_own)) # male - female # Dotplot of 100 permuted differences in proportions ggplot(homeown_perm, aes(x = diff_perm)) + geom_dotplot(binwidth = .001) We can go further and run 1000 permutations and create a density chart. # Perform 1000 permutations homeown_perm &lt;- homes %&gt;% rep_sample_n(size = nrow(homes), reps = 1000) %&gt;% mutate(HomeOwn_perm = sample(HomeOwn)) %&gt;% group_by(replicate, Gender) %&gt;% summarize(prop_own_perm = mean(HomeOwn_perm == &quot;Own&quot;), prop_own = mean(HomeOwn == &quot;Own&quot;)) %&gt;% summarize(diff_perm = diff(prop_own_perm), diff_orig = diff(prop_own)) # male - female # Density plot of 1000 permuted differences in proportions ggplot(homeown_perm, aes(x = diff_perm)) + geom_density() References "],

# Writing Functions in R
***
Notes taken during/inspired by the Datacamp course 'Writing Functions in R' by Hadley and Charlotte Wickham.

R can create functions using a basic 'receipe' as Hadley calls it

> my_fun <- function(arg1, arg2) {
>
>   body
>
> }

Unlike in other languages, there is no special syntax for naming a function.

##

SQL is the native language for interacting with databases (RDBMS).  Many non-SQL systems, such as Hadoop and Spark, will often have a SQL above to make extracting and analysing possible.   

```{r setup}
library(RPostgreSQL)

# create a connection
# save the password that we can "hide" it as best as we can by collapsing it
pw <- {
  "<password goes here>"
}

# loads the PostgreSQL driver
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
# creates a connection to the postgres database
# note that "con" will be used later in each connection to the database
con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname = "films",
                 host = "localhost", port = 5432,
                 user = "postgres", password = pw)
rm(pw) # removes the password

# Sets knitr to use this connection as the default so we don't need to specify it for every chunk
knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection = "con")
```


```{sql}

```

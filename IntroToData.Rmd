# Introduction to Data
***
Notes taken during/inspired by the Datacamp course 'Introduction to Data' by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel.  The supporting textbook is @OS3.

## Language of Data

The course makes use of the openintro package, accompanying the textbook.  LEt's load the package and our first dataset, email50.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Load packages
library("openintro")
# Load data
data(email50)
# View its structure
str(email50)
```












`r if (knitr:::is_html_output()) '# References {-}'`
